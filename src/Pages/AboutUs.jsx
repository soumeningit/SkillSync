              SkillSync was born from a common frustration: talented teams
              struggling with disconnected tools and a lack of clarity on who
              does what best. As developers, designers, and project managers, we
              experienced this firsthand.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
              In 2023, we set out to build the solution we wished we hadâ€”a
              platform that not only connects people through chat but also
              connects their skills to the work that needs to be done. Today,
              SkillSync is helping thousands of teams worldwide build better,
              faster, and more cohesively.
